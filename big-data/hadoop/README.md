# Hadoop

## Directories

```console
/usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/3.2.1_1/libexec/etc/hadoop
/usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/3.2.1_1/libexec/
/usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/3.2.1_1/libexec/logs
```

## Format namenode (relies on on hdfs-site.xml for configuration)

```bash
hdfs namenode -format
```

## **_Before proceeding the SSH server must be installed see the appendix for more details_**

## Start hadoop

```bash
start-all.sh
```

## Stop hadoop

```bash
stop-all.sh
```

# Appendix

## Install SSH server

Solution: Check if sshd is running

```bash
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
```

If not enabled you have to enable via the UI.

```
1.Open the Apple menu in the upper left corner of the screen, and select "System Preferences...".
2.Under "Internet & Wireless", select "Sharing".
3.In the left column of services, enable "Remote Login".
4.Highlight the "Remote Login" service and enable access for the users you would like to have SSH access.
5.You can select all users, or specific users by selecting "Only these users:" and adding the appropriate users by clicking "+".
6.Take note of the command displayed underneath the words "Remote Login: On" in the upper middle part of the screen.
7.Write this command down as you will need it to log in from a different system.
8.If your firewall is enabled (which it is by default), you may need to restart the firewall to allow SSH communications to pass through port 22.
9.Open "System Prefrences", click "Security", and restart the Firewall.

Test that the firewall is not blocking SSH access by going to a different system and entering the ssh login command in step 6 above.

If you cannot login, restart the firewall or reboot.
```

Verify by re-running

```bash
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
```

Now add your public key to authorization

```console
.ssh ❯ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
.ssh ❯ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Verify by should not request password

```console
ssh localhost
```

## Error when trying to start-dfs.sh

```console
~HADOOP_CONF_DIR ❯ start-dfs.sh

This error occurs because sshd is not installed. @see Install ssh server for fix.

## Resource Manager is not running

.ssh ❯ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
